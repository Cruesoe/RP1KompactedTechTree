# RP1KompactedTechTree

Often frustrated with the general large and overwhelming layout of the RP-1 Tech Tree I decided to see if I could rework it into something neater.

No parts have been changed this is layout only mod, can be added and removed from a save game.

Lines to 'Blue-Sky' nodes have been removed to offer a cleaner overall look to the Tree.  The dependencies remain. Blue Sky nodes are in line with the items they unlock.

Row order has been re-arranged to try untangle as many lines as possible.
